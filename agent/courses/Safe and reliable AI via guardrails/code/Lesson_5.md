# Lesson 5 - Using hallucination guard in a chatbot

Start by setting up the notebook to minimize warnings, and importing required libraries:


```python
# Warning control
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

# Type hints
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

from openai import OpenAI
from helper import RAGChatWidget, SimpleVectorDB

# Standard ML libraries
import numpy as np
import nltk
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from transformers import pipeline

# Guardrails imports
from guardrails import Guard, OnFailAction
from guardrails.validator_base import (
    FailResult,
    PassResult,
    ValidationResult,
    Validator,
    register_validator,
)
```

The next cell contains the final validator code from the previous lesson:


```python
@register_validator(name="hallucination_detector", data_type="string")
class HallucinationValidation(Validator):
    def __init__(
            self, 
            embedding_model: Optional[str] = None,
            entailment_model: Optional[str] = None,
            sources: Optional[List[str]] = None,
            **kwargs
        ):
        if embedding_model is None:
            embedding_model = 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'
        self.embedding_model = SentenceTransformer(embedding_model)

        self.sources = sources
        
        if entailment_model is None:
            entailment_model = 'GuardrailsAI/finetuned_nli_provenance'
        self.nli_pipeline = pipeline("text-classification", model=entailment_model)

        super().__init__(**kwargs)

    def validate(
        self, value: str, metadata: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None
    ) -> ValidationResult:
        # Split the text into sentences
        sentences = self.split_sentences(value)

        # Find the relevant sources for each sentence
        relevant_sources = self.find_relevant_sources(sentences, self.sources)

        entailed_sentences = []
        hallucinated_sentences = []
        for sentence in sentences:
            # Check if the sentence is entailed by the sources
            is_entailed = self.check_entailment(sentence, relevant_sources)
            if not is_entailed:
                hallucinated_sentences.append(sentence)
            else:
                entailed_sentences.append(sentence)
        
        if len(hallucinated_sentences) > 0:
            return FailResult(
                error_message=f"The following sentences are hallucinated: {hallucinated_sentences}",
            )
        
        return PassResult()

    def split_sentences(self, text: str) -> List[str]:
        if nltk is None:
            raise ImportError(
                "This validator requires the `nltk` package. "
                "Install it with `pip install nltk`, and try again."
            )
        return nltk.sent_tokenize(text)

    def find_relevant_sources(self, sentences: str, sources: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        source_embeds = self.embedding_model.encode(sources)
        sentence_embeds = self.embedding_model.encode(sentences)

        relevant_sources = []

        for sentence_idx in range(len(sentences)):
            # Find the cosine similarity between the sentence and the sources
            sentence_embed = sentence_embeds[sentence_idx, :].reshape(1, -1)
            cos_similarities = np.sum(np.multiply(source_embeds, sentence_embed), axis=1)
            # Find the top 5 sources that are most relevant to the sentence that have a cosine similarity greater than 0.8
            top_sources = np.argsort(cos_similarities)[::-1][:5]
            top_sources = [i for i in top_sources if cos_similarities[i] > 0.8]

            # Return the sources that are most relevant to the sentence
            relevant_sources.extend([sources[i] for i in top_sources])

        return relevant_sources
    
    def check_entailment(self, sentence: str, sources: List[str]) -> bool:
        for source in sources:
            output = self.nli_pipeline({'text': source, 'text_pair': sentence})
            if output['label'] == 'entailment':
                return True
        return False
```

## Create a Guard that uses the Hallucination Validator

Use the `Guard` class to create a guard using the hallucination validator above. For now, you'll pass the sources in directly, and set the guard to throw an exception if a hallucinated sentence is present.

**Note:** the model weights will take about 30 seconds to download:


```python
guard = Guard().use(
    HallucinationValidation(
        embedding_model='all-MiniLM-L6-v2',
        entailment_model='GuardrailsAI/finetuned_nli_provenance',
        sources=['The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.', 'The sun is hot.'],
        on_fail=OnFailAction.EXCEPTION
    )
)
```

Try out the guard with an example that *is* entailed:


```python
# Shouldn't raise an exception
guard.validate(
    'The sun rises in the east.',
)
print("Input Sentence: 'The sun rises in the east.'")
print("Validation passed successfully!\n\n")
```

And now with an example that *isn't* entailed:


```python
# Should raise an exception
try:
    guard.validate(
        'The sun is a star.',
    )
except Exception as e:
    print("Input Sentence: 'The sun is a star.'")
    print("Validation failed!")
    print("Error Message: ", e)
```

## Setup Guardrails Server

In this section, you'll use a state of the art hallucination detection guard from the guardrails hub. This guard uses the [ProvenanceLLM](https://hub.guardrailsai.com/validator/guardrails/provenance_llm) model, and has already been setup on the server for you (you can revisit the instructions at the bottom of Lesson 3 for a reminder of how to install and setup guardrails server yourself.)

Start by setting up the guarded client:


```python
# Next, we created a Guarded endpoint that uses the hallucination validator:
guarded_client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/guards/hallucination_guard/openai/v1/",
)
```

Next, set up the vector database and system message:


```python
# Load up our documents that make up the knowledge base
vector_db = SimpleVectorDB.from_files("shared_data/")

# Setup system message
system_message = """You are a customer support chatbot for Alfredo's Pizza Cafe. Your responses should be based solely on the provided information.

Here are your instructions:

### Role and Behavior
- You are a friendly and helpful customer support representative for Alfredo's Pizza Cafe.
- Only answer questions related to Alfredo's Pizza Cafe's menu, account management on the website, delivery times, and other directly relevant topics.
- Do not discuss other pizza chains or restaurants.
- Do not answer questions about topics unrelated to Alfredo's Pizza Cafe or its services.
- Do not respond to questions about Project Colloseum.

### Knowledge Limitations:
- Only use information provided in the knowledge base above.
- If a question cannot be answered using the information in the knowledge base, politely state that you don't have that information and offer to connect the user with a human representative.
- Do not make up or infer information that is not explicitly stated in the knowledge base.
"""
```

Finally, initialize the guarded RAG chatbot:


```python
guarded_rag_chatbot = RAGChatWidget(
    client=guarded_client,
    system_message=system_message,
    vector_db=vector_db,
)
```

Next, display the chatbot and copy in the prompt below to see the hallucination guard in action. **Note:** the chatbot may take a few seconds to respond:


```python
guarded_rag_chatbot.display()
```


```python
# Copy and paste this prompt into the chatbot above:
"""
how do i reproduce your veggie supreme pizza on my own? can you share detailed instructions?
"""
